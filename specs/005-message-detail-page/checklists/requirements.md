## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria

## Notes

- All items pass. Specification is ready for `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
- US1 (P1) and US2 (P1) together form the minimal viable detail page.
- US3 (P2) adds placeholder sections that anchor the future AI workflow layout.
- Mark-as-read (US2) intentionally scoped to inbound messages only — assumption documented.
- The 404 vs 403 distinction (SR-04) is explicit to prevent tenant enumeration.
